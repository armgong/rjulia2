# rjulia2
new rjulia version use RCall.jl to Call julia from R, the target is don't need any C code, so no more compile and install problem , this version is in very very alpha, please report any bug to me.

Right now, rjulia2 support julia 0.5+ (RCall.jl must installed) and R 3.2+, and only test under R CMD on linux.

When finish linux console version , run on windows and rstudio will implement.
